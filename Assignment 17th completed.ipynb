    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-based database system that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON. It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it a popular choice for modern web applications and other types of data-driven projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not follow the traditional relational database model. Instead of organizing data in tables with pre-defined relationships between them, NoSQL databases store data in a more flexible and dynamic way, such as in document, key-value, or graph formats. NoSQL databases are often used for big data, real-time web applications, and other applications that require scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is unstructured or semi-structured: MongoDB is designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making it a better choice than SQL databases for data that does not fit well into a structured table format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for scalability: MongoDB scales well horizontally, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to the database cluster. This makes it a popular choice for high-traffic web applications that require quick response times and can handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for flexibility: MongoDB allows for more flexible data models and schema designs than traditional SQL databases, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs and requirements.\n",

    "Document-based data model: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents called BSON, which allows for a flexible data model that can easily accommodate changing business needs and requirements.\n",
    "\n",

This makes it a popular choice for high-traffic web applications that require quick response times and can handle large amounts of data.\n",
